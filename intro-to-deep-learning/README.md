## Lessons
### 1. A Single Neuron
Learn about linear units, the building blocks of deep learning.
### 2. Deep Neural Networks
Add hidden layers to your network to uncover complex relationships.
### 3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Use Keras and Tensorflow to train your first neural network.
### 4. Overfitting and Underfitting
Improve performance with extra capacity or early stopping.
### 5. Dropout and Batch Normalization
Add these special layers to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.
### 6. Binary Classification
Apply deep learning to another common task.
